altoclef
Plays block game.

Powered by Baritone.

A client side bot that can accomplish any Minecraft task that is relatively simple and can be split into smaller tasks. "Relatively Simple" is a vague term, so check the list of current capabilities to see examples.

Became the first bot to beat Minecraft fully autonomously on May 24, 2021.

How it works
Take a look at this Guide from the wiki or this Video explanation

Current capabilities, Examples:
Obtain 400+ Items from a fresh survival world, like diamond armor, cake, and nether brick stairs
Dodge mob projectiles and force field mobs away while accomplishing arbitrary tasks
Collect + smelt food from animals, hay, & crops
Receive commands from chat whispers via /msg. Whitelist + Blacklist configurable (hereby dubbed the Butler System). Here's a Butler system demo video
Simple config file that can be reloaded via command (check .minecraft directory)
Beat the entire game on its own (no user input.)
Print the entire bee movie script with signs in a straight line, automatically collecting signs + bridging materials along the way.
Become the terminator: Run away from players while unarmed, gather diamond gear in secret, then return and wreak havoc.
Download
Note: After installing, please move/delete your old baritone configurations if you have any. Preexisting baritone configurations will interfere with altoclef and introduce bugs. This will be fixed in the future.

Nightly Release (Recommended) (has the latest bug fixes)
Start by downloading the Latest Long Term Release, then Download the Nightly & replace altoclef-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.

If the Nightly Link doesn't work, check the latest Build Action that succeeded and download Artifacts.zip (you must be signed into GitHub). Replace your existing altoclef-4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar with the one found in Artifacts.zip

Long Term Release
Check releases. Note you will need to copy over both jar files for the mod to work.

Meloweh's Extra Features Release (Unofficial)
Has some schematic support, command macros and a few utility features. Will eventually be merged, but if you can try it out now if you'd like:

AltoClef jar
Baritone jar
Versions
This is a fabric only mod, currently only available for Minecraft 1.19.2-1.19.3.
